Q = (Your Question)
A = (Final Answer)
W = (working img or something))
S = (section sin/cos/tan, inverse functions, bearings etc)

From Daksh...Maybe we can also do something like this : 

An example image will already be there, with random A, O, H lengths.

Then when the user enters a value for either of the lengths / angles we can edit the image live. Obviously it would be a canvas or drawing and not an image. And then update all the missing sides / angles, with another color (maybe green)

And we can have a separate page, where we have all the calci's like sin / cos / tan, etc

==========================================================

Dhiraj:

We can add a calculator like desmos but we can make it a bit more easy to use (limited to trig functions and basic maths)

we can also add a "Test" page where after the user completes everything, they get to attempt a test which will be graded

Vote : 
Daksh - GOOD IDEA...The test thing seems good. we can make random questions with different side lengths.
